        <p>Dear Tom & Darcie,</p>
        <p>
          I wanted to take a moment and do something to say a very sincere thank you to you both for helping secure grant funding to cover the costs of my program at Epicodus. The best way I figured I could do so was with my new skill set.
        </p>
        <p>
          To share a little about this project, the heavy lifting of this project is accomplished in a design styling language called Sass - a language that I hadn't actually worked with until I set out to do this project. Additionally, the background image is a digital painting I created in Photoshop for this application - this was another tool I worked with for the first time, and it might just be my new favorite artistic medium. There are several animated elements that I created through the styling language alone - including the twinkling stars in the background, and animated snow and clouds softly blowing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The work that you did to continue searching for more funding for me, Darcie, and more people to provide funding for, Tom, has lifted a significant financial burden off of me. Being no stranger to student debt already, I truly can't express my gratitude enough to you both and your advocacy for me. Thank you for your dedication to your job and the students you represent and support.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope you both had a peaceful, cozy holiday season!
        </p>
        <p>Cheers,</p>
        <p>Danielle Thompson</p>
